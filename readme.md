The bright future of Web Components
===================================

Slides for a talk about Web Components.

Originally conceived for [CodeMotion Rome 2020](https://events.codemotion.com/conferences/rome/2020/) in Rome, 2020-03-27. Aired instead for [CodeMotion Online Tech Conference - Italian edition](https://events.codemotion.com/conferences/online/2020/online-tech-conference-italian-edition/).

Built on top of [P-Slides](https://github.com/MaxArt2501/p-slides)!

## Building

Node.js 10.x is required (actually it could work in Node 8 - haven't checked).

To start the presentation in development mode:

1. Clone the repository;
2. `npm i`
3. `npm run serve`

Or `npm run build` to just build it, then serve `/public` with your HTTP server of choice.

## Tests

... what?
