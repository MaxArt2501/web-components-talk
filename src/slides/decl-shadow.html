    Web Components have always heavily relied on JavaScript. And that's a problem,
    because they're quite opaque to search engines and social media sharing,
    as they might not execute the JavaScript bits to hydrate the laconic tags that
    we put in the markup. So here it comes a new proposal&hellip;

  <h2 class="our-header">Declarative Shadow DOM</h2>
  <p-fragment class="self-center">
    <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;daily-question>
  &lt;template shadowroot="open">
    &lt;h2>Question of the day&lt;/h2>
    &lt;slot>&lt;/slot>
  &lt;/template>
  &lt;p>Is the cat inside?&lt;/p>
&lt;/daily-question></code></pre>
  </p-fragment>
  <p-notes>
    All we have to do is to define the content of the WC using the good ol' <code>&lt;template></code>
    element with this new <code>shadowroot</code> attribute, that takes "open" or "closed" as
    values like the possible modes of <code>.attachShadow</code>. So this could be done by a server!
  </p-notes>
</p-slide>
<p-slide>
  <pre class="self-center"><code class="language-js">class DailyQuestion extends HTMLElement {
  constructor() {
    super();
    // A custom element now *might* have
    // a shadow root already attached
    if (!this.shadowRoot) {
      this.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' });
      this.shadowRoow.innerHTML = '...';
    }
    ...
  }
  ...
}</code></pre>
  <p-notes>
    Now when the class gets instantiated, it might already have a shadow root defined by the DSD,
    so we'd have to check its presence.
  </p-notes>
  <p-notes>
    This is also retro-compatible, meaning that re-declaring a shadow root
    with <code>.attachShadow()</code> will just remove the one created by
    the Declarative Shadow DOM, letting old Web Components still work.

  <h3 class="our-header">Easy styles!</h3>
  <pre class="self-center"><code class="language-html">&lt;retro-banner>
  &lt;template shadowroot="open">
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="/eigthies.css">
    &lt;h1>&lt;slot>&lt;/slot>&lt;/h1>
  &lt;/template>
  Bring the `80s back!
&lt;/retro-banner></code></pre>
  <p-notes>
    DSD also makes it easy (again) to load stylesheets for Web Components. All you need to do is to
    insert a <code>&lt;link></code> element inside the template, as we used to do with JavaScript.
    The stylesheet gets cached too, so it won't be loaded again for all the other instances of the same
    component.
